Upgrade: From 0.5 to 0.6
------------------------

Starting with Chicago Boss 0.6, projects follow an OTP layout, and the admin
interface is a standalone OTP application.

To upgrade, you will need to do the following in your project:

    mkdir src
    mkdir priv
    mv controller/ init/ lib/ mail/ model/ test/ view/ src/
    mv lang/ static/ priv/
    PROJECT=my_application mv boss.routes priv/$PROJECT.routes

In addition, you will need to prefix your controller modules with the application
name. E.g.

    mv blog_controller.erl my_application_blog_controller.erl

This avoids module naming conflicts when multiple applications are installed on
the same server (which was not possible prior to 0.6).


Upgrade: From 0.5.x to 0.5.y
----------------------------

Starting with Chicago Boss 0.5, the framework source is kept separate from your
project source. After downloading and building a new copy of CB, you need to update
your server scripts to point to the new source. Open "start-dev.sh" and "start.sh"
and make sure there is an argument like this:

    -pa /path/to/new/ChicagoBoss/ebin

You might also want to update your /admin interface by copying the "skel/admin"
directory from the new CB over to your project directory.


Upgrade: From 0.4 to 0.5
------------------------

The easiest way to upgrade from 0.4 is to create a new CB app and copy your source
into it. In the CB source directory, type:

    make
    make app PROJECT=mynewproject
    cd ../mynewproject
    cp -a /path/to/existing/project/view \
          /path/to/existing/project/model \
          /path/to/existing/project/controller \
          /path/to/existing/project/static \
          /path/to/existing/project/boss.config \
          .

Then start the server with ./start-dev.sh


Upgrade: From 0.4.x to 0.4.y
----------------------------

Starting with Chicago Boss 0.4, application upgrades are as simple as:

   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/[a-z]* .

In general, files in the project directory that start with an upper-case letter
belong to Boss. Files which start with a lower-case letter belong to you.


Upgrade: From 0.3 to 0.4
------------------------

The directory structure has changed somewhat. The MVC files have moved around, and
files for the /admin interface are in a separate directory (ADMIN). 

The following steps should get you most of the way to an upgrade:

   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/boss.config .
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/Web/*_controller.erl controller/
   rm controller/admin_controller.erl
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/Web/*.erl lib/
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/Model/* model/
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/Web/*_views view/
   rm -r view/admin_views
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/static/* static/
   make clean
   make
